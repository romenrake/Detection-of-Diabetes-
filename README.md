# Detection-of-Diabetes-
A data science project done during my Verzeo Project Based Internship.

# INTRODUCTION

Diabetes mellitus (DM), commonly known as just diabetes, is a group of metabolic disorders characterized by a high blood sugar level over a prolonged period of time. Symptoms often include frequent urination, increased thirst and increased appetite. If left untreated, diabetes can cause many health complications. Acute complications can include diabetic ketoacidosis, hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state, or death. Serious long-term complications include cardiovascular disease, stroke, chronic kidney disease, foot ulcers, damage to the nerves, damage to the eyes and cognitive impairment.
## Types of Diabetes
There are three main types of diabetes: type 1, type 2, and gestational diabetes (diabetes while pregnant).
#### Type 1 Diabetes
Type 1 diabetes is thought to be caused by an autoimmune reaction (the body attacks itself by mistake) that stops your body from making insulin. Approximately 5-10% of the people who have diabetes have type 1. Symptoms of type 1 diabetes often develop quickly. It’s usually diagnosed in children, teens, and young adults. If you have type 1 diabetes, you’ll need to take insulin every day to survive. Currently, no one knows how to prevent type 1 diabetes.
#### Type 2 Diabetes
With type 2 diabetes, your body doesn’t use insulin well and can’t keep blood sugar at normal levels. About 90-95% of people with diabetes have type 2. It develops over many years and is usually diagnosed in adults (but more and more in children, teens, and young adults). You may not notice any symptoms, so it’s important to get your blood sugar tested if you’re at risk. Type 2 diabetes can be prevented or delayed with healthy lifestyle changes, such as losing weight, eating healthy food, and being active.
#### Gestational Diabetes
Gestational diabetes develops in pregnant women who have never had diabetes. If you
have gestational diabetes, your baby could be at higher risk for health problems. Gestational diabetes usually goes away after your baby is born but increases your risk for type 2 diabetes later in life. Your baby is more likely to have obesity as a child or teen, and more likely to develop type 2 diabetes later in life too.
## DATASET INTRO
This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.
### Content
The datasets consist of several medical predictor variables and one target variable, Outcome. Predictor variables include the number of pregnancies the patient has had, their BMI, insulin level, age, and so on.
#### Variable Description
##### Pregnancies: 
Number of times pregnant
##### Glucose:
Plasma glucose concentration a 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test
##### BloodPressure:
Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
##### SkinThickness: 
Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)
##### Insulin: 
2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
##### BMI: 
Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)
##### DiabetesPedigreeFunction: 
Diabetes pedigree function
##### Age:
Age (years)

# TOOLS USED:
1. Python 3
2. Jupyter Notebook 
3. Python libraries- pandas, numpy ,sklearn, pickel ,matplot.
# CONCLUSION:
The accuracy is to be highest in Logistics regression  and we are able to predict if a person is diabetic or not by tuning the models , saving and evaluation using that model.
